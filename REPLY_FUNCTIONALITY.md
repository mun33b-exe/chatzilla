# Reply Functionality Implementation

## Overview
The ChatZilla app now supports WhatsApp-style reply functionality, allowing users to reply to specific messages in conversations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Reply Gestures**
- **Long Press**: Long press on any message to set it as a reply target
- **Swipe**: Swipe left (for sent messages) or right (for received messages) to trigger reply

### 2. **Visual Indicators**
- **Reply Preview**: When replying, a preview appears above the input field showing the original message
- **Reply in Bubble**: Messages that are replies show the original message context at the top
- **Cancel Button**: Easy cancellation of reply with an X button in the preview

### 3. **Message Threading**
- Messages maintain references to their parent messages
- Reply chain information is preserved in Firestore
- Visual hierarchy shows which message is being replied to

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model Changes
- Added `replyToMessageId`, `replyToContent`, `replyToSenderId` fields to `ChatMessage`
- Updated Firestore serialization/deserialization

### State Management
- Added `replyingToMessage` to `ChatState`
- Implemented `setReplyToMessage()` and `clearReply()` methods in `ChatCubit`

### UI Components
- `ReplyMessageWidget`: Reusable component for displaying reply context
- Updated `MessageBubble`: Added gesture handling and reply display
- Enhanced `ChatMessageScreen`: Integrated reply preview and message sending

## Usage

### For Users:
1. **To Reply**: Long press or swipe on any message
2. **Cancel Reply**: Tap the X button in the reply preview
3. **Send Reply**: Type message and send normally

### For Developers:
```dart
// Set a message as reply target
chatCubit.setReplyToMessage(message);

// Clear current reply
chatCubit.clearReply();

// Send message with reply
chatCubit.sendMessage(
  content: "Reply text",
  receiverId: receiverId,
  replyToMessage: replyMessage,
);
```
